# ShellCheck configuration for ilma project
# Focus on practical checks while allowing legitimate bash patterns

# Disable overly strict rules that don't apply to config-driven projects
disable=SC1091  # Not following sourced files (we use dynamic config loading)
disable=SC1090  # Can't follow non-constant source (legitimate for .ilma.conf, type configs)
disable=SC2034  # Variable unused (many are exported/config variables used externally)
disable=SC2086  # Double quote to prevent globbing (legitimate for find expressions like PRUNE_EXPR)

# Allow external sources when possible for better analysis
external-sources=true

# Keep all other checks enabled for:
# - Syntax errors and dangerous patterns
# - Consistency and style issues  
# - Real unused variables (not config/exported ones)
# - Proper quoting and word splitting issues
# - Array handling best practices
